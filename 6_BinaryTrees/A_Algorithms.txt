1.  Morris Traversal - For Traversal
    Algorithm: (for inorder Traversal)
    current = root
    while(root != null)
        if left doesn't exist :
            print(current)
            current = current.right
        else :
            predecessor = find(current) --> predecessor (move left then right until its null)
            if(predecessor.right == null) 
                predecessor.right = current
                current = current.left
            else :
                predecessor.right = null
                print(current)
                current = current.right
